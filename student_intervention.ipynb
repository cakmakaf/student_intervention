At the time of prediction, each tree is used to address a prediction and every result is counted as a vote. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).\n",

When we ask to Nancy about Arthur's situation she will first look at the data which includes features that a given person having some features will be and another person passing over such features will not. She will then endeavour to generalize a pattern from the previous data that she has already learned and will start to ask questions about Arthur such as \"What is his GPA?\", \"How many days he was absent?\" and so on, like game of 20 questions. At the end of the mini survey, Nancy could simply tell Arthur's situation, Yes (CALL him) or No (NOT CALL him). The decsion making process of Nancy is look like a decision tree where each question that she asked about him is a node of the tree and answers to each question is a path in the tree that will end in either YES or NO at the corresponding leaf.\n",

    "Let's we have an employed person in CA named Arthur and we want to know wheter Arthur will donate or not? Now assume that we have Charity ML employee, named Nancy. When we ask to Nancy about Arthur's decision she will first look at the data which includes features that a given person having some features donates and another person passing over such features does not. She will then endeavour to generalize a pattern from the previous data that she has already learned and will start to ask questions to Arthur such as \"What's your highest degree?\", \"Are you married?\" and so on, like game of 20 questions. At the end of the mini survey, Nancy could simply tell Arthur's situation, Yes or No. The decsion making process of Nancy is look like a decision tree where each question that she asked to him is a node of the tree and answers to each question is a path in the tree that will end in either YES or NO at the corresponding leaf. Now we have a decision tree but it is pron to errors since it is only depending on Nancy's survey. To correct Nancy, let's say officials X, Y and Z also asked the same question as \"Will Artur be summoned or not?\" In order to make more accurate results, let's also give them a slightly different trainig data set instead of the same data set that Nancy has already used before. Then they will ask different questions about Arthur to get a conclusion. This process will reduce the error rate as they all asked different sets of questions about him. If the majority says Arthur is positive as a possible to fail his graduation then we can assure that he is from the set of the individuals who will likely to be summoned and we may send them a notice of call. After the voting, we decide the final conclusion. All of the previous ensemble of trees create a forest and since the data that all been used is random, the algorithm is called Random Forrest Algorithm.\n",
