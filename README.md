## Project: Building a Student Intervention System

In this project, we constructed an intervention mechanism that demonstrates supervised learning techniques. We built a model that will make prediction about the likelihood that a given student will pass, deciding whether an intervention is necessary.


### Purpose:

In this project a hypothetic school wants to identify students who need intervention before they drop out of school. We formalized the factors that predict how feasible a student is to pass their final exam, by constructing an intervention system that based on supervised learning techniques. We analyzed the dataset on students' progress and develop a model that will predict the possibility that a given student would pass, or he/she would need an intervention.


### Code

The code is provided in the `student_intervention.ipynb` notebook file. In addition, `student-data.csv` dataset file is required to complete our work. While some of the code has already been implemented to get start, we will need to implement additional performance when needed to able to complete the project.


### Run/Execution

The project has 3 files:

student_intervention.html: Report File

student_intervention.ipynb: This is the master file that Icontributed to complete the project.

student-data.csv: Dataset File.

To execute the code, Python 3.X is rquired. For the sake of convenience Anaconda platform always recommended to be able to use Jupyter Notebook. If you only interested to see the result then click which file youwant o your browser and navigate it.
